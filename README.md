# trinitite

This is a project based on modern OpenGL and C++ (GL 3.2 and up, and C++11 ISO standards)

The goal of the project is not defined, it is entirely experimental and will end up wherever it ends up.

Some ideas I have are procedural terrain generation in 3 dimensions, particle simulations using Newtonian mechanics and electromagnetic effects, and integration into a Python3 server client base.
